# Rifts of Ratnakar

Rifts of Ratnakar is a collaborative [Squadron Strike](https://www.adastragames.com/squadron-strike) game using a custom setting and the Squadron Strike ship design toolkit.

This repository serves as a base for ship models, which can be used for SSD images and box minatures. It currently consists of the following sections:
* `render.py`: A Python 3.11 script intended to be run by [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). Using data generated from the included spreadsheet it automatically generates Blender files and SSD images of the "base" hulls.
* `/images`: A folder containing SSD images of the "base" hulls. Side and Top views are provided in formats usable for SSDs.
* `/models`: A folder containing Blender files of the "base" hulls.

## Collaboration
Players of the Rifts of Ratnakar game are welcome (and encouraged!) to use the base Blender files to customize the ships of their own bespoke fleet by adding components, textures, and more! Bring your fleet to life!
