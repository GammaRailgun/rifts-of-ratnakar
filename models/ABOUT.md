Base models created by the included Blender script.

Usage notes:
1. Snapping between the engine cans and hull is not guaranteed. If modifying this model, it is the user's responsibility to ensure there is not a microgap between the hull and engine cans.
2. Parent-child relationships have not been established for ease of modeling. It is the user's responsibility to create links appropriately.
